          "body": "<p>Origin Energy chief executive Frank Calabria has warned of a “messy” fall-out from the ultra-low wholesale prices on the national electricity market that helped <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/origin-barely-scrapes-a-profit-amid-soft-power-prices-20210217-p573fx\" target=\"_blank\">almost cancel out net profit</a> for the giant power and gas supplier in the December half.</p><p>“These wholesale prices are unsustainable:.There will be a supply response, it’s just whether it will be planned or unplanned,” Mr Calabria said after Origin saw bottom-line earnings plunge 98 per cent to just $13 million in the first half of 2020-21.</p><p>Origin has already temporarily halted output at one unit of its huge baseload coal plant at Eraring on NSW’s Central Coast amid wholesale prices at six-year lows due to a flood of cheap renewable energy onto the market. Mr Calabria’s comments suggest other less flexible plants may suffer unexpected outages as owners cut back investment amid poor returns.</p><p>Such a voluntary cutback in generation as at Eraring is highly unusually in what is typically the peak demand month requiring full output from all generators, and in stark contrast to the situation 12 months ago in a sweltering summer and in a pre-COVID-19 climate with stronger electricity demand.</p><p>“One year on it’s very different,” Mr Calabria said, pointing to some external one-off factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has softened electricity demand, and the milder summer, but also to more structural trends such as increased renewable power, partly driven by government policies.</p><p>The comments come after <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/coal-power-stations-going-broke-schott-20210216-p572xn\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Security Board chair Kerry Schott warned earlier this week</a> that coal power plants are “going broke” and some risked closing four or five years before the end of their rated life. Brett Redman, CEO of Origin’s rival AGL Energy, last week said some black coal power generators were struggling to cover their cash costs.</p><p>Mr Calabria said Eraring, the country’s biggest coal power generator with 2880 megawatts of capacity, is relatively well off but that those with less flexible generation or with take-or-pay coal purchase contracts will be worse affected.</p><p>“Everyone will have to make their own assessment around that,” Mr Calabria said. “I think it’s going to be a pretty messy period of time”</p><p>The drop in wholesale power prices prompted Origin to warn of more “challenging” times ahead for its core energy markets business, with profits expected to drop further this June half and continue softer into fiscal 2022.</p><p>But Origin looks set to reap benefits from its diversified business, with a brighter outlook for the Australia Pacific LNG venture in Queensland, which should benefit from the rise in oil and LNG prices this half.</p><p>Bottom-line earnings dived 98 per cent to $13 million in the six months to December 31, while underlying earnings more than halved to $224 million.</p><p>That profit figure before one-time items still beat consensus expectations of $159 million, with analysts at UBS, RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley all saying the result beat their expectations.</p><p>Origin, which <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/energy-majors-smashed-by-surging-renewables-20210204-p56zjn\" target=\"_blank\">warned earlier this month of a two-year hit to profits from lower wholesale power prices</a>, trimmed its interim dividend to 12.5¢ per share from 15¢ a year earlier.</p><p>The softer outlook for energy markets caused Standard &amp; Poor’s earlier this month to flag a possible cut to Origin’s BBB credit rating.</p><p>Chief financial officer Lawrie Tremaine said Origin remained committed to its BBB rating and believed it could both invest in growth and continue to pay out 30-50 per cent of cash flow in dividend. But Origin “needs to progress with caution”, Mr Tremaine said.</p><p>Moody’s echoed S&amp;P’s concerns on Thursday, with vice-president Nicholas Chapman describing Origin’s results “at the weaker end of our expectations”. He said they “further highlight the amalgam of headwinds affecting the energy sector”.</p><p>Shares in Origin were down 2.4 per cent at $4.49 in mid-afternoon trading.</p><p>Origin restated <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/origin-warns-on-energy-markets-profits-20210204-p56zgs\" target=\"_blank\">its guidance from earlier this month</a>, signalling full-year underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of between $1 billion and $1.14 billion for the energy markets business. That signals a significantly weaker second half after the $635 million reported for the first half, which was down 12 per cent.</p><p>Production for APLNG for the full year is expected to be between 687 and 705 petajoules, and the venture is expected to break even in terms of paying a distribution to Origin at between $US24 and $US28 per barrel of production, including finance costs.</p><p>Origin said it expects to get a cash distribution from APLNG, of which it owns 37.5 per cent, of between $575 million and $675 million at a realised oil price of $US43 a barrel.</p>",

Some investors were hoping for a $1 a share capital return.</p><p>The net profit result for the six months ending December 31 was struck on sales of $17.8 billion, up 16.6 per cent, and included $34 million ($24 million after tax) of restructuring costs at Kmart Group, which is closing or converting 167 Target stores.</p><p>Before one-off costs, net profits rose 25.5 per cent to $1.41 billion, beating consensus forecasts around $1.29 billion, despite $30 million in COVID-19 related costs and the group’s decision to pay pandemic leave to staff when stores were closed during the three-month lockdown in Melbourne.</p><p>Earnings before interest and tax rose 25.2 per cent to $2.17 billion as strong double-digit profit growth at Bunnings, Kmart Group and Officeworks offset weaker profits in the energy, chemical and fertilisers business.</p><p>Bunnings, which accounts for almost 60 per cent of group profits, was once again the star performer. Earnings rose a better than 35.8 per cent to $1.27 billion as total sales jumped 24.4 per cent to $9 billion and same-store sales rose 27.7 per cent (vs 4.7 per cent in the year-ago period) even though the hardware retailer was forced to close its stores in Melbourne for three months.</p><p>Officeworks and Kmart Group also did better than expected despite store closures and COVID costs.</p><p>Officeworks’ earnings rose 22 per cent to $100 million as sales rose 23.7 per cent to $1.5 billion, with higher sales of low margin technology products and higher labour costs crimping margins.</p><p>Profits from the Kmart Group rose 42 per cent to a record $487 million (before one-off costs) as sales rose 9 per cent to $5.4 billion. Both Kmart and Target faced widespread stock shortages but cut back on promotions, boosting margins, and converted Target stores performed well.</p><p>Online retailer Catch, which was acquired in June 2019 for $230 million, benefited from the acceleration in online spending, with gross transaction values rising 95.6 per cent. However, Catch’s earnings were impacted by increased investment in technology, marketing and fulfilment capacity to support future growth.</p><p>Excluding the Catch marketplace, online sales across the group grew 125 per cent to $1.4 billion. Including Catch online sales in the half reached $2 billion, equivalent to online sales for the entire 2020 year.</p><p>WesCEF’s earnings fell 7.5 per cent to $160 million as revenues decreased 6.6 per cent to $830 million. Earnings were hurt by increased competition in ammonium nitrate, weaker gas prices and weaker export demand in the sodium cyanide business as a result of international gold mine closures due to COVID-19.</p><p>In the industrial and safety division, which includes Blackwoods, Workwear and Coregas, earnings before one-off costs rose 68 per cent to $37 million as sales rose 4.7 per cent to $898 million. Earnings in the year-ago period were hit by payroll remediation costs.</p><p>Wesfarmers expected to incur COVID costs of about $10 million per quarter, down from $15 million a quarter in the first-half.</p><p>Mr Scott said the decision to pay an 88¢ a share fully franked dividend (up from 75¢ a share last year) reflected Wesfarmers’ strong result and balance sheet but also available franking credits, credit metrics and the need to preserve flexibility to manage continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic and to take advantage of value-accretive growth opportunities.</p><p>Wesfarmers paid an 18¢ special dividend and a final dividend of 77¢ last year.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/retail/wesfarmers-lifts-interim-dividend-after-bumper-result-20210215-p572nv\" target=\"_blank\">Full story here.</a></p>",

The idea that a bank could be everything to everyone – transaction accounts, personal loans, mortgage, credit card – is disappearing because of changing consumer behaviour and the rise of fintech.</p><p>Elliott argues banks will increasingly have to choose what they will and won’t do, and use partnerships and alliances to both differentiate their product offering from their rivals and free up capital to invest in key growth areas.</p><p>ANZ’s focus areas are emerging: mortgages, small business and the institutional banking market. But the refining of its growth strategy is a work in progress.</p><p>Take mortgages.</p><p>Trying to become a big mortgage factory churning out the lowest rate in the market wouldn’t be sensible for ANZ, which has a market share of 15 per cent.</p><p>But Elliott says a product suite that sees customers through the property life cycle – saving for a home, finding a home, buying that home, living in that home, renovating that home and upgrading to a new home – would be more differentiated, more tailored and, no doubt, offer better margins.</p><p>But ANZ won’t manufacture all the products in that suite. Instead, it’s likely to do more of what it did late last year when it formed a joint venture with a $34 billion <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p56nnq\" target=\"_blank\">French giant called Worldline to provide merchant services to SME customers.</a></p><p>This was a business that ANZ was OK at, but not great. By partnering with Worldline it gave customers a better service and freed up capital to invest in other areas.</p><p>Elliott says it’s a template ANZ can use further in the coming years as it narrows its focus. Big data and API technology, which lets banks seamlessly integrate products from partners into their own systems, is opening up a raft of possibilities, he says.</p><p>The challenge for ANZ – and really any big bank – is getting the balance right between growth, rewarding shareholders who saw dividends dive last year, and maintaining the foundations that have seen the banks sail through the pandemic.</p>",

But Coleman believes this is only the start of a period of normalisation in energy markets he has long predicted.</p><p>It’s also a good backdrop for the long-delayed final investment decision <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p56uva\" target=\"_blank\">for Woodside’s Scarborough project.</a> Coleman has always said the company needed a few quarters of better prices before it could hit the button; the company can now prepare for the big decision in the second half of this calendar year safe in the knowledge its view on the supply/demand balance is coming to fruition.</p><h2>Big trucks helps Seven to big Boral gain</h2><p>Seven Group chief executive Ryan Stokes is feeling pretty good about the progress new <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p570xh\" target=\"_blank\">Boral chief executive Zlatko Todorcevski is making at the building materials company</a>.</p><p>And why not? Since Seven started buying Boral stock on March 16 last year, the stock is up 76 per cent, with Seven’s 20 per cent stake valued at $1.26 billion. Todorcevski has a long way to go in his turnaround, but this is already looking like a handsome winner for Seven.</p><p>But that Stokes was willing and able to make that investment last year, when many in the market were raising capital or paying down debt, speaks to the confidence provided by Seven’s operating businesses and particularly the WesTrac mining equipment division, which again performed well in the December half.</p><p>Earnings before interest and tax rose 14 per cent to $211.4 million in the half, as new equipment was commissioned for big projects at BHP (South Flank) and Rio Tinto (Koodaideri). With a string of new projects yet to ramp up – including Fortescue’s Eliwana and Iron Bridge projects and Newmont Boddington project – and the <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p572x1\" target=\"_blank\">big iron ore miners demonstrating plenty of confidence about the outlook</a>, Stokes is understandably confident in the near-term outlook for WesTrac.</p><p>EBIT at Coates rose 1 per cent as Seven delivered good cost cuts to offset a 7 per cent decline in revenue. Stokes remains confident that the rush of infrastructure projects long predicted will arrive, but COVID-19 is introducing a degree of uncertainty that will require Coates to remain lean and flexible.</p>",
